# EVALUATION TRACES

The traces obtained during the evaluation can be found at the
following
[link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6-PINSZBYUNaXFrY0lCTmNGNTA?usp=sharing).
Two different applications have been tested: an android 4.4 stock one
(default browser) and an external one
([aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/)). Both the apps have been tested
with the two different TRACEDROID 4.4 images: the one that performs
full tracing and the other that does not trace system jar executed
bytecode. This, hence, results in a total of 4 folders containing the
various traces.
