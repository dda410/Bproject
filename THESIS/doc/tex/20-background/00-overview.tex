\chapter{Background Information}
\label{chap:background}

The \textsc{TraceDroid} sandbox enables profiling of Android applications by
modifying the Dalvik VM of Android \cite{ref1}. It is important, hence, to
understand how Android works, how its system architecture is designed
and especially how the virtual machine running the applications is
structured. This chapter contains a brief overview of the whole
architecture and a detailed explanation of the runtime core, namely
the DVM.
