\section{Porting limitations}
\label{sec:porting_limitations}

Features and limitations of our implementation are discussed in this
section. Most of the original code concerning \textsc{TraceDroid} based on
android 2.3.4 has been successfully adapted to the sources of android
4.4. There are, however, some functionalities that could not be ported
due to bugs or unexpected behavior. We give in table 4.1 a
comprehensive list of the main features of the system with a brief
explanation of their functionalities, in which file they are
implemented and their porting status. The shorthand 'P' for ported,
'NP' for not ported and 'T' for testing is used.

  % body of table
  uid interface & Init.cpp & P & Allows to trace a specified app by storing its uid in the /sdcard/uid file \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Distinguish method enter, exit and exception throwing & Profile.cpp & P & Makes it possible to produce different traces based on whether a method entrance, a method exit or an exception is throw is being profiled. dvmMethodTraceAdd() detects the type of action and calls a method to handle it. The three methods that can be called are handle\_method, handle\_return, handle\_throws.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Tracing return values when profiling a method exit & Profile.h & P & The TRACE\_METHOD\_EXIT macro declaration is augmented to hold the returning value of a method. The value is passed as a parameter from the calls to this macro present in the files under dalvik/vm/.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Tracing exceptions when a thrown statement is caught & Profile.h & P & The TRACE\_METHOD\_UNROLL macro declaration is augmented to hold the thrown exception of a method. The value is passed as a parameter from the Exception.cpp file.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Compute method calls' timestamps and indentation. & Profile.cpp & P & Implemented by getWhitespace() method.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Compute method modifiers & Profile.cpp & P & Implemented by getModifiers() method.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Compute a method's return type and class descriptor & Profile.cpp & P & Both the functionalities are implemented by the convertDescriptor() method.  \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Compute string representation of parameters and return value containing both types and values & Profile.cpp & P & The string representation of a returning value is calculated by parameterToString(). Since parameters can be more than one, the computation of their string representation is implemented in getParameters() and getParameterString(). The former returns an array of string representations, the latter a singular string representation with the content of this array. \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Filter calls executing bytecode from a system jar & Profile.cpp & T & This feature, implemented in the dvmMethodTraceAdd() method, allows to omit the traces regarding methods that execute bytecode from a system jar where also the caller consist of bytecode from a system jar. Not tracing these calls speeds up the system and excludes to profile calls that are assured not to contain malicious code. It has been implemented completely differently due to unexpected behavior of the original one that was ported. \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Compute string representation of a Java object & Profile.cpp & NP & This functionality, originally implemented by the objectToString() method, consists in getting the string representation of a parameter or returning value if it is a Java object. The method calls the object's Java class toString() method in the case there is one. A boolean variable, called inMethodTraceAdd(), is also needed in dvmMethodTraceAdd() not to trace the calls to the toString() method. \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Creating trace files under /sdcard/ according to format dump.PID.TID & Profile.cpp & P & Implemented by prep\_log() method. It creates dump files for the current process for each of its threads. The process id and the thread id is part of the dump filenames. This allows distinguishing between the traces of each thread of the profiled application. \\
  & & & \\
  \hline
  Printing traces to dump files & Profile.h & P & Implemented by the ALOGD\_TRACE macro. It acquires a lock to write to the dump files and then it writes the trace logs to the thread dump file.\\
  & & & \\
\end{longtabu}

As it can be seen in table 4.1 most functionalities have been
successfully ported and adapted to Android 4.4 source code. The
features with the 'T' status have not been included in the stable
version of the system since the code implementing them is still in
testing. They are included in a separate source code branch with a
different compiled system image.

In the stable version of \textsc{TraceDroid}, hence, the filtering of calls
executing bytecode from a system jar was not included. This results in
larger output traces for the application we are profiling, increasing
also the computation steps required by the system. The second feature
that has not been ported was about computing the string representation
of the parameters and returning Java objects. It has been substituted
by printing the class descriptor of the object and the keyword
\textit{“Object”} to highlight that the parameter or the returning value is a
Java object created by that class.
